Developing a fully decentralized, open-source social media platform with limitless potential, built on the Hedera network. The app features a 3D globe interface, allowing users to interact with and write data to the Hedera network, with logic to read and display that data seamlessly.

Key Features:

Personalization: Users can customize usernames, profile pictures, and 3D models visible to others via a P2P sharing system. They can link URLs to usernames, associate topic IDs with profile pictures, and save personalized UI settings to the Hedera mirror node.
Geospatial Interaction: Users can post markers and polygons on the 3D globe with customizable settings, creating interactive, location-based content.
Community Governance: Users can create topics, set rules for each, and allow admins to moderate which messages are displayed by default.
Secure Communication: The platform supports group chats and end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging using ED25519 keys.
Data Management: Users can load topic data, filter messages by date or user, and block unwanted messages. Future features will include a truth/false rating system (similar to likes/dislikes).
IPFS Integration (being developed): The app incorporates IPFS for decentralized file sharing (images, videos, files). Users pin content locally, and others can replicate pins, creating a viral yet user-controlled data-sharing system. Users can set up Android phones as personal nodes for always-on data availability. They can choose specific nodes to host their always-on pins, with node creators setting a price per GB for storage. An automated validation system ensures seamless transactions, and node creators are rated based on uptime, incentivizing reliability. Users earn rewards by participating in this decentralized storage ecosystem with a transparent validator rating system.
Real-World Applications: The platform enables 3D models of real-world locations, allowing users to pin data to specific places. Imagine a global, interactive game-like experience akin to GTA, with real-world economic interactions and transparent fund tracking.
Institutional Use: Institutions can create NFT-based IDs (topic IDs) to filter messages, enable voting, and enhance transparency.
The app is optimized for mobile devices, with plans to expand features and accessibility. By leveraging Hedera’s efficiency and IPFS’s decentralized storage, this platform empowers users to control their data, share creatively, and participate in a trust-based, decentralized ecosystem.

A heartfelt shoutout to Kantor, Patches, and all the brilliant minds advancing transformative technology across the globe!

Side note: It would be great to involve Pi Network in this, as they have several million registered users. They could create a token on the Hedera network and transfer their mainnet to it.
